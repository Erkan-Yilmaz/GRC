The below actions manifest themselves now on steemit (July 2017), but there can happen always such possibilities on other sites.
* Thus using github in between is a nice solution to give you, the reader, better solutions.

Some links are downvoted at the moment on steemit :-(

Effects of this downvoting being, e.g.
* article is not shown in the gridcoin stream above due to its value sinking to zero
* even if someone finds the post: it takes time to see all:
  * most users likely don't see how to unhide the pictures (which is at the very end of the article: SHOW)

<br>

In case they get further downvoted on steemit, new links will be added here on github, additionally to the steemit links.

In such a case I also ask you to upvote the steemit post, so it gets "unhidden" again over time. Thank you!

P.S. you can also like, ... here on github by using "Add a reaction" where you have different emoticons.
